Why 3D Animation and Video Game Design at WST?

I decided to take 3D Animation and Video Game Design at West Sound Tech because I wanted to improve my skillset as a game designer (level designer). I had previously taken various related classes at my home high school (which is SKHS for reference), however those classes didn't do a very good job at teaching game design or game development. Most of my knowledge prior to taking 3D Animation and Video Game Design was obtained through the internet and my various (unreleased) projects. My previous projects ranged from working on Pokemon Rom Hacks to creating mods for games like Minecraft and The Sims 3 however most of these were never fully completed and therefore never released to the public.
